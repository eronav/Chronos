# Chronos
## Inspiration
Mental health is a serious problem in the world, and the biggest we face as highschoolers is managing the limited time we have to achieve the best we can.  

## What it does
Chronos simplifies this for the user by combining all the necessary tools in one place. It includes a place for the user to create to-do lists, mark big events/projects on a calendar, have a Pomodoro timer for efficient studying, a journal page to help organize thoughts, and finally explore new extra-curriculars to pursue.

## How we built it
As a group, we used Replit to work together, coding in HTML, CSS, and JS

## Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was formatting the button, images, and text around the page.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating working apps in our website that are able to run without errors

## What we learned
We learned how to work together and use our shared resources and knowledge to produce the best output.

## What's next for Chronos
By making the design more professional, adding functionalities, we hope to add pricing plans and make it go mainstream.
